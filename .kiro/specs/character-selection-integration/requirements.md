# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating the character selection functionality from the external characterSelection.js file directly into the index.html file. Currently, the character selection code exists in a separate JavaScript file but is not properly referenced in the HTML. The goal is to fully integrate this code into the HTML file to match the structure in the reference repository, eliminating the need for the external file.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the character selection code from characterSelection.js directly into index.html, so that all character selection functionality is contained within a single file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the index.html file THEN the system SHALL include all character selection functionality from characterSelection.js within script tags
2. WHEN the integration is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT require the external characterSelection.js file
3. WHEN the integration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing character selection functionality
4. WHEN the integration is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure all DOM element references are correctly maintained

### Requirement 2: Code Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the integrated code maintains consistency with the existing codebase, so that there are no conflicts or errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is integrated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent variable naming conventions
2. WHEN the code is integrated THEN the system SHALL ensure proper event handling for character selection
3. WHEN the code is integrated THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with Three.js functionality
4. WHEN the code is integrated THEN the system SHALL preserve all character selection UI interactions

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the character selection process to be optimized, so that the game loads faster and performs better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is integrated THEN the system SHALL reduce the number of external file references
2. WHEN the code is integrated THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve the loading time of the character selection UI
3. IF any code optimizations are possible THEN the system SHALL implement them during integration

### Requirement 4: Clean-up

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove the now-redundant characterSelection.js file, so that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is complete and verified THEN the system SHALL remove the characterSelection.js file
2. WHEN the integration is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure no references to the external characterSelection.js file remain
